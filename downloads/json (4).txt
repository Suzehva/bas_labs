Because Scope 3 emissions are beyond our direct operational 
control, the efforts our suppliers take to reduce their 
emissions help us progress toward our ambition to achieve 
net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. We will prioritize working 
with suppliers who are also committed to decarbonization 
and reaching net-zero carbon emissions. We have identified 
a list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly supporting 
our operations, and expect those suppliers, who collectively 
contribute more than 50% of emissions globally to Amazon’s 
Scope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how they will 
decarbonize their operations and demonstrate real progress 
over time. pg 13

First and foremost, we are innovating and investing to eliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses. Second, we are driving meaningful and necessary actions outside of our value chain, through nature-based and technological solutions, to enable a credible carbon market for companies that will need to neutralize remaining emissions. As stated in The Climate Pledge, these solutions must be additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially-beneficial. https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/amazon-2021-carbon-neutralization.pdf

Various conditions set for offsetting projects https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/amazon-2021-carbon-neutralization.pdf

We use nature-based solutions to mitigate carbon emissions outside of our value 
chain and supplement the carbon reduction efforts we’re driving across our operations.

In parallel to reducing and avoiding emissions throughout 
our business, we are also investing in carbon neutralization 
through additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and 
socially beneficial offsets. As part of this effort, we are 
engaging in science-led collaborations to build credible 
neutralization initiatives that can be deployed at scale in 
the future.,memberships,,gdp_real,,annual_revenue,524897000000,population,,industry,Retail,sector,,employees,1541000,market_index,,ghg,,inventory_year,2015,higher_net_zero,,coal_exploration,Not applicable,coal_exploration_phaseout_year,,coal_production,Not applicable,coal_production_phaseout_year,,coal_use,No phaseout,coal_use_phaseout_year,,coal_pathways,,coal_pathways_other,,coal_notes,,coal_source_links,https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2022-sustainability-report.pdf,oil_exploration,Not applicable,oil_exploration_phaseout_year,,oil_production,Not applicable,oil_production_phaseout_year,,oil_use,No phaseout,oil_use_phaseout_year,,oil_pathways,,oil_pathways_other,,oil_notes,Power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030.,oil_source_links,https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2022-sustainability-report.pdf,gas_exploration,Not applicable,gas_exploration_phaseout_year,,gas_production,Not applicable,gas_production_phaseout_year,,gas_use,No phaseout,gas_use_phaseout_year,,gas_pathways,,gas_pathways_other,,gas_notes,Power our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2030.,gas_source_links,https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2022-sustainability-report.pdf,slug,amazon-com-0121,country_name,United States of America,gcap_id,GCAP18834,signpost_climate_laws_label,,signpost_climate_laws_url,,signpost_eciu_label,,signpost_eciu_url,,signpost_influence_map_label,C+,signpost_influence_map_url,https://lobbymap.org/company/Amazon-6ef39ea5f5d349615d709268befdb436,signpost_climate_action_tracker_label,,signpost_climate_action_tracker_url,,signpost_new_climate_label,Low Integrity,signpost_new_climate_url,https://newclimate.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/NewClimate_CorporateClimateResponsibilityMonitor2023_Feb23.pdf#page=74,signpost_climate_watch_url,,signpost_ccnm_url,,end_target_status_slug,in-corporate-strategy
