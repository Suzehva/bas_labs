That is why we have set ourselves the long-term goal
 of becoming net carbon neutral by no later than 2050, with ambitious emission reduction targets set for as early as 2030. This includes our
 supply chains, plants and business divisions as well as our customers’ use of the vehicles. The biggest contribution to reducing our emissions is being made by electric mobility. To underline our commitment and live up to the responsibility Volkswagen Group has, decarbonization is a key element in the NEW AUTO strategy and is one of the focus topics in the Group’s initiative to improve ESG performance.

By 2030, we want to reduce CO₂ emissions by 30% compared to the baseline year 2018. Volkswagen wants to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions in production by 50.4% in absolute terms compared to
2018 by 2030. By 2030, the Group wants to
emit 30% less CO2 on average per vehicle (passenger cars and light
commercial vehicles) over the entire life cycle than in 2018. The Volkswagen Group has set itself the goal
of implementing energy efficiency measures from 2018 to 2030 that
save a total of 4.9 million MWh of energy at the production sites.,target_notes,,source_url,https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/publications/corporate/association-climate-review-2023-1810,gasses_coverage,Carbon dioxide only,territorial_emissions,,consumption_emissions,,international_aviation,,international_shipping,,scope_1,Yes,scope_2,Yes,scope_3,Partial,interim_scope_1,Yes,interim_scope_2,Yes,interim_scope_3,Yes,historical_emissions,No,coverage_notes,End Target Scope 3: "SBTi has confirmed the aim of reducing CO₂ emissions¹ by 30% in the use phase (Scope 3) to the Volkswagen Group as in line with the limitation of global warming to 2 °C."

The level of ambition for the decarbonization targets is considered a minimum requirement for the Group brands, which are also free to set higher targets themselves. For example, Volkswagen wants to reduce its CO₂ emissions per vehicle in the EU by 40% and significantly exceed the Group-wide target of 30% by 2030 (base year of 2018). Porsche aims to become a net carbon-neutral company by 2030.

Removals: "We consider protecting natural carbon sinks to be an important task. Measures in this area should be both scalable and able to ensure the additionality and permanence of atmospheric carbon sequestration. To underpin our commitment to climate protection projects and be able to develop our own projects in accordance with the highest standards, VW Kraftwerk GmbH and ClimatePartner GmbH have established the joint venture Volkswagen ClimatePartner GmbH. It develops and funds certified climate protection projects that serve the recognized offsetting of CO2 emissions. One key requirement for all projects is that they meet the highest quality standards. For this reason, the joint venture also takes control with regard to quality assurance. Core aspects include additionality, accuracy and permanence of the emission reductions, the socioeconomic and environmental advantageousness for the region and regular audit by independent third parties. The initial project standards are the VCS, CCBS and GS. The joint venture commenced its operational work in 2022 and is focusing on forest protection projects and nature based solutions. It is accompanied by a specially established independent project advisory board. In 2022, Volkswagen became the first automotive manufacturer to join the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance). Together with governments and companies around the world, the initiative supports the protection of tropical rain forests and thus makes an important contribution to achieving the Paris climate goals, protecting biodiversity and realizing sustainable development."
